Repository of Rapid Detection of Cardiac Pathologies by Neural Networks Using ECG signals (1D) and sECG images (3D) project

The detection of cardiac pathologies is performed using electrocardiogram signals that be represented in the time and frequency domain (1D signals). However, this technique can present difficulties, such as the high cost of private health services or the time taken by the public health system to refer the patient to a cardiologist. In addition, the variety of cardiac pathologies (more than 20 types) is a problem in diagnosing the disease. On the other hand, one of the little-explored techniques for this diagnosis is surface electrocardiography (sECG). sECGs are 3D images (two dimensions in space and one in time). For this research, two models, LSTM and ResNet34 Neural Networks, were developed. The present study proposes the basis for developing a Decision Support Software (DSS) based on machine learning models.

The Database 1 is :

The Database 2: 

This contains the surface ECG (sECG) images built in Matlab from database 1.
